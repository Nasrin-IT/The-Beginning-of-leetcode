Today I have sloved a Problem in leetcode using Java program
In leetcode it is 7Th problem 

Question : To reverse interger they given 3 case with one constraint 

GIVEN 
  CASE -1 : input : X = 123 , output : 321
  CASE-2  : input : X = -123 , output: -321
  CASE-3  : input : X = 120 , output : 21

Constraint: it is a condition  given to a problem 
  here the condition is :
    The input number x must be a 32-bit signed integer.
That means:
The value of x should be greater than or equal to −2³¹
And less than or equal to 2³¹ − 1
In simple words:
👉 The number must be within the range of −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
Also,
👉 If reversing the number causes it to go outside this 32-bit integer range, you must return 0.

CONCLUSION  :
    I have sloved this problem using Java program by satisfying all 3 cases and the constraint
